    <h2 style="color:palevioletred">What I've Learned in this Course</h2> 
    <p style="color:hotpink">Internet is essentially a global network made up of billions of computers. These billions of computers <br> communicate with
        each other which allow people to share information in so many different ways! 
        The <br> internet operates through these physical cables that even wireless connections rely on in order to access the global network.</p>
    </p> 
    <p style="color:hotpink">World Wide Web is all the public websites or pages that anyone can have access to from their own or local <br>computers 
        through the internet. Pages and various documents are interconnected using hyperlinks that users will <br>click on to find 
        more information. This information includes things like; text, audio, video, and images.</p>
